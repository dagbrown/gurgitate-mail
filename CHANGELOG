 - Made it deal correctly with headers that have tabs between the colon
   and the data, instead of spaces (bug #154).

1.2.1:

 - Made it NOT BLOW UP when you give it an email with a header that
   has no contents.  (Aren't those supposed to be illegal?  Regardless,
   I have to deal with whatever turns up, be it kosher or no)

 - Made its installer also politely install a man page

1.2:

 -  Fixed some header handling which was kind of, er, broken.
    Specifically, I'd get an exception on a header which looked
    like:

    Subject:
        Hi there

    The only kind of email that I've ever seen this kind of header
    on has been spam, but nonetheless, it's hardly fair for a mail
    filter to blow up just because it's given crappy input.


 -  Made the comments more rdoc-friendly.

    Fixed the handling of multi-line headers--it was getting it
    RONG RONG RONG (but I've probably implemented this RONG RONG
    RONG too).


 -  Made it so that as well as saying 
                                
    g=Gurgitate::Gurgitate.new(filehandle)
    if g.head =~ /evil@bad.com/ then delete end
                                
    you can also say             
                                
        Gurgitate::Gurgitate.new(filehandle) do
            if head =~ /evil@bad.com/ then delete end
        end                         
                                
    Which gives you another place to put your .gurgitate-rules.


 -  Made install.rb work as both a script as a library, because
    I switched to using rake to build things, rather than make.


 -  Made it canonicalize headers to a standard capitalization,
    because some SMTP client (*cough*virus*cough*) is incorrectly
    sending out all-uppercase headers.

1.1.3:

 -  Put the whole thing into a big module, and added some extra
    comments to make it more rdoc-friendly.  You shouldn't need to
    change your .gurgitate-rules.rb if you use it like that, but
    if you use it as a module, you'll need to prefix 'Gurgitate::'
    to your Gurgitate object construction.

1.1.2: maintenance release

  - Changed gurgitate-mail so that it compiles cleanly under Ruby 1.8,
    and made it work with no warnings.

1.1.1: maintenance release

  - Fixed the regexes for my own email addresses--they had backslashes
    in strange place, causing people to ask odd questions.

    Fixed a typo (thanks to Tom Wadlow)--I was using an undefined
    local variable "sendmail" instead of a class variable "@sendmail".

1.1:

  - Implemented Pavel Kolar's suggestion that if you filter email
    through an external program, you might want the results of that,
    instead of just a return code.

  - Added a default value to the Gurgitate initializer parameter.

  - Added an "install.rb" script to install the script and library
    files into their proper locations.

  - Pulled the "Gurgitate" class and friends out into a separate file,
    and made "gurgitate-mail" into a tiny script which does a
    "require" to pull the gurgitate-mail stuff in.  This should make
    it easier to extend in the future.

  - Added this file to the distribution. :-)

1.0.1: maintenance release

  - Small code cleanup--changed some accessors to use attr_*.

1.0:

  - Initial release of gurgitate-mail
