    Made it canonicalize headers to a standard capitalization,
    because some SMTP client (ahem) is incorrectly sending out
    all-uppercase headers.

1.1.3

    Put the whole thing into a big module, and added some extra
    comments to make it more rdoc-friendly.  You shouldn't need to
    change your .gurgitate-rules.rb if you use it like that, but
    if you use it as a module, you'll need to prefix 'Gurgitate::'
    to your Gurgitate object construction.

1.1.2 - maintenance release

    Changed gurgitate-mail so that it compiles cleanly under Ruby 1.8,
    and made it work with no warnings.

1.1.1 - maintenance release

    Fixed the regexes for my own email addresses--they had backslashes
    in strange place, causing people to ask odd questions.

    Fixed a typo (thanks to Tom Wadlow)--I was using an undefined
    local variable "sendmail" instead of a class variable "@sendmail".

1.1

    Implemented Pavel Kolar's suggestion that if you filter email
    through an external program, you might want the results of that,
    instead of just a return code.

    Added a default value to the Gurgitate initializer parameter.

    Added an "install.rb" script to install the script and library
    files into their proper locations.

    Pulled the "Gurgitate" class and friends out into a separate file,
    and made "gurgitate-mail" into a tiny script which does a
    "require" to pull the gurgitate-mail stuff in.  This should make
    it easier to extend in the future.

    Added this file to the distribution. :-)

1.0.1 - maintenance release

    Small code cleanup--changed some accessors to use attr_*.

1.0

    Initial release of gurgitate-mail
